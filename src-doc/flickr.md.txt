# flickr data structures

each user has:

--------------- -------------------------------------
set             your own photos
collection      sets of sets
gallery         others' photos (structured)
tag             [obv]
people          ?
archive         ?
favorite        others' photos (unstructured)
contact         friends
group           ?
testimonial     ?
--------------- -------------------------------------

# initial data scrape

subgraph of n users, ? photos

- pick a well-connected seed; breadth-search to obtain n sample users.
- for each sample user,
	- for each photo by them, 
		- get photo's tag list, and save into database
- hereafter, only consider these sample users and photos. references to items
  not in our sample should be ignored.

# needed data structures

## social

1. get friends
	- flickr.contacts.getPublicList

## ptable

1. get indexes / tgraphs

2. more well-connected 

## tgraph

...

## index

### from user photosets

link to documents
:	- all photos in set
	- all favourites tagged with set's "related" tags
	- all gallery-photos tagged with set's "related" tags

aggregate related sets into one index

### from a group pool

link to documents
:	- all photos in pool
	- related member photos

link to indexes
:	- get related tags
	- flick.groups.search on those tags
	- find the results "page" which contains self, and add groups from that page only
	- add maybe a random half of those pages, using an algorithm that increases clustering

### large-scale structure

need some way of generating "higher-level" indexes that cover more general tags etc...
