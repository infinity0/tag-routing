LocalIndex and LocalTGraph need to check for loops
Probability needs to check for div/0 errors

(cleanup)
- review Maps.viewSubMap
- review CompositeMap, MeanEntropyComposer
- test ProbabilityEntropyTGraphComposer, ProbabilityIndexComposer

(laterz)
- rename Probability to just Prob?
- rename SPUProbabilityInferer to ShortPathUnionProbInferer?
- possibly move AddressScheme.pushNode* into ProtoAddressScheme

(very later)
- add tags.rout.IndexComposer to the design document
- explain how tags are scored, in the design document


(architecture issues)
current architecture has each QueryProcessor spawn new Contact/Naming/Routing
layers. ideally, Contact should be split off from this, since the information
it uses is independent of any query.

to do this we first need to extend MessageReceiver.recv() to accept a "sender"
argument, or something.



In Kleinberg's model, geographic location is a uniting factor. In this model,
language is a uniting factor.
