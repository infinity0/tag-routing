"The interaction between layers is co-ordinated by implementing each layer as a state machine"

== Tasks ==

algorithm
- actually implement the traversal algorithms described in design.md.txt;
  current implementation uses much simpler and more questionable algorithms.
- make a better ValueComposer, turns out Mean*Composer is actually pretty shit

scraper has deadlock issues
- commitGroupPhotos is leaking, but not commitUserPhotos...
- put all the database stuff into a "Sample" class

(cleanup)
- review Maps.viewSubMap
- review CompositeMap, MeanEntropyComposer
- test ProbabilityEntropyTGraphComposer, ProbabilityIndexComposer

(more laterz)
- decide whether we want to synchronized all methods in Contact, Naming, Routing
- rename Probability to just Prob?
- rename SPUProbabilityInferer to ShortPathUnionProbInferer?
- rename AddressScheme to just AddrScheme
- make Probability, Entropy both subclass some DoubleWrapper parent class or smth

== Integrity checks ==

- make sure nodes don't point to themselves (LocalIndex, LocalTGraph, etc)
- probability needs to check for div/0, also that P(A*B) <= P(A), P(B)

- there is a problem even with this; since we merge data from several different
  data sources it's entirely possible that after the merge, we end up with
  invalid probabilities... the merge algorithm isn't robust enough to handle
  such a case at the moment.

== Architecture ==

- current architecture has each QueryProcessor spawn new Contact/Naming/Routing layers
- Contact should be split off from this, since the information it uses is independent of any query; it can go in QueryEnvironment
- we also need to extend MessageReceiver.recv() to accept a "sender" argument, or something
- this is so that Contact knows who to send replies back to...
