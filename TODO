LocalIndex and LocalTGraph need to check for loops
Probability needs to check for div/0 errors

(cleanup)
- review Maps.viewSubMap
- review CompositeMap, MeanEntropyComposer
- test ProbabilityEntropyTGraphComposer, ProbabilityIndexComposer

(laterz)
- add tags.rout.IndexComposer to the design document
- explain how tags are scored, in the design document

(more laterz)
- rename Probability to just Prob?
- rename SPUProbabilityInferer to ShortPathUnionProbInferer?
- rename AddressScheme to just AddrScheme
- make Probability, Entropy both subclass some DoubleWrapper parent class or smth

== Architecture ==

- current architecture has each QueryProcessor spawn new Contact/Naming/Routing layers
- Contact should be split off from this, since the information it uses is independent of any query; it can go in QueryEnvironment
- we also need to extend MessageReceiver.recv() to accept a "sender" argument, or something
- this is so that Contact knows who to send replies back to...

== Observations ==

In Kleinberg's model, geographic location is a uniting factor. In this model,
language is a uniting factor.

Dynamic following of hyperlinks...


- invert pt.db to get tp.db
- make double->probability adaptors for StoreControl
- plot address scheme



== Integrity checks ==

- make sure nodes don't point to themselves
