	>Since network latency is far greater than processing latency, we design these algorithms to be inherently concurrent. Operations involving retrieval of remote objects are non-blocking and allow other work to be done whilst waiting for its results.</p
	><p
	>The system is partitioned into several layers, each dependent on the one below it. The lower layers (contact, naming, routing) correspond to the data planes introduced previously; the top layer provides the results to the user&rsquo;s original query, and interacts directly with the user.</p
	><p
	>Each layer has an interface for interacting with the layer above it, and a framework that co-ordinates between the various tasks that make up the layer. Some are quite general and complex, and have a wide range of applications - so these are specified as upgradable modules. For our prototype, we only suggest some basic heuristics for these, and briefly comment on their reliability and usefulness; better solutions can be explored by future projects.[EXTN]</p
	><p
	>The lower layers retrieve and process data from the appropriate plane. The underlying algorithms have no &ldquo;natural&rdquo; termination condition; data retrieval can theoretically proceed until the entire network has been searched. In practice, each layer does not do this spontaneously; instead, they respond to requests for data from the layer above. By default, we discontinue sending new requests in all layers after a given number of results have been returned, and allow the user to resume from the paused state, resources permitting.</p
