- compare inferred address scheme with true address scheme
- test whether these match our expectations (nodes further out are "more general")
- basically, some measure of how similar two graphs are?





query test:

1. score (f1_score, precision, recall)
2. steps to run the algorithm
3. closeness(id, tag)

(1) is dependent variable, it's what we're interested in
(2) is not that interesting since we expect recall better, and
(3) independent variable

plot (1) against (3) for a small set of (2)
set of (2) we can take to be [32, 64, 128, 256]


more sophisticated score would take into account the distance between results docs and actual docs
