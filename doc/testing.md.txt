- compare inferred address scheme with true address scheme
- test whether these match our expectations (nodes further out are "more general")
- basically, some measure of how similar two graphs are?

examine(id, tag):
- some measure of "how far" a given identity is from a given tag.


query test
- we have 4 dimensions:
  1. score (relevance, recall, so could be 2 dimensions here)
  2. steps to run the system
  3. distance of id to tag
  4. how big the id is

(1) is dependent variable, it's what we're interested in
(2) is not that interesting since we expect recall better, and
(3) dependent variable
(4) dependent variable

plot (1) against (3) for a small set of (2), (4)
plot (1) against (4) for a small set of (2), (3)

set of (2) we can take to be (32, 64, 128, 256)

score_results(tag, results):
	return relevance and recall scores
