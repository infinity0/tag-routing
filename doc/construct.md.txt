# Routing system

java, blah blah blah

description of java packages

- heavy use of generics
- proxy objects, etc. java collections framework very flexible, extend this.
- abstraction - QueryAgent, QueryEnvironment, QueryProcess
- message passing


# Data generation

## Crawler

python, flickrapi, etc

description of python modules
- threading for quick development, python-futures
- libraries used: flickrapi, igraph, sqlite3
- heavy optimisation, use of databases, tmpfs, custom pickle formats

- development speed & availability of libraries vs optimisation

## Data format

- data format used - GraphML, no good java libraries, heavy subclassing and
  hack an existing library (JUNG) to read attribute types. required reading
  a significant part of the GraphML specification.

- luckily igraph is good at both reading and writing
- used Graphviz for visualising graphs, convert to .dot format
